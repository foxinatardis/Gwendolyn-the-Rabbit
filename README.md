# Gwendolyn the Rabbit
This game is a Christmas present for my neice.

An infinite scroller where you take on the role of Gwendolyn the Rabbit hopping from platform to platform, eating carrots and fighting snowmen.

This HTML5 game works best is Chrome or Safari. Practice your double jump, you'll need it.

Some find this game has a steep learning curve, though they may not have grown up on Super Mario World.

Graphics were created with my 7-day free trial of adobe illustrator.
